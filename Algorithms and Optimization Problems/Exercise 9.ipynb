    "Finco Investment Corporation wishes to determine an investment strategy for the firm for the next 3 years. At present (Year 0), $100,000$ is available for investment. The goal is to maximize the cash on hand at the end of Year 3. \n",

    "There are five investment options, each of which allows you to put in an arbitrary amount of principal at a given time, and will payoff a certain percentage of the principal at a later time. (The payoff includes all of the money you will get back; you won't get back the principal at a later time.) The five options are summarized below:\n",

    "To ensure that the company’s portfolio is diversified, Finco required that at most \\$75,000 be placed in any single investment option. Payoffs happen at the beginning of the year, so can be reinvested in the same year. For example, the positive cash flow received from Option C in Year 1 can be reinvested immediately in Option B. However, Finco cannot borrow funds, so net cash on hand must be non-negative in all years. Formulate this as a linear optimization problem."

    "\n",
    "A company sells items of various sizes and ships them to customers using special boxes. While the sizes of the items are fixed, the company can decide what sized boxes to use for shipping. The following table lists the types of items, along with the minimum box size needed for each item, as well as the number of each item that needs to be shipped. \n",

    "For simplicity, the company limits the set of possible box sizes to be exactly the sizes listed in the table above. In order to satisfy demand, the company can always use a larger box to ship a smaller item. For example, a type-1 item can be shipped with a box of size 1.5, but can also be shipped using boxes of sizes 1.7 or 2.0. \n",
    "\n",
    "While larger boxes are more flexible, they are also more expensive to make: **the variable cost** (in dollars) of making each box is exactly equal to the box size. However, the higher variable cost might be worth it since to produce a box of a certain size, the company needs to pay a **fixed cost** of 1000 to create the mold. So using larger boxes might allow the company to make do with fewer box types, which would lower the total fixed cost. For example, using boxes of all three types would incur a fixed cost of 3000, while using only boxes of size 2.0 would incur a fixed cost of 1000. \n",

Moreover, the schedules for the next two semesters have already been published, and this gives her information about scheduling conflicts as well as how much time she can afford to spend on these electives after accounting for her mandatory courses and other responsibilities. **Each course is a single semester long and can be taken only once, but the same course may be offered in both semesters, so she can choose when to take each course as well as whether to take it.** These information are summarized in the three tables below.\n",
